Restaurant Management System
       1. Introduction:
The purpose of this system is to create an online Restaurant Management System using the web framework Django. From this project, the stakeholders (Internal stakeholder: project team, restaurant manager and External stakeholder: customer) will be benefited in real life and during this current pandemic. In this system, the customers must create an account to access the website and see the menu, reserve time slot through online in restaurant and can see vacancy announcements. Here admin can see the information of users and information of the restaurants and managers of restaurant can update their information (discounts) and can post vacancy announcements.


2. Problem Definition:

A customer can easily search or view information of their favorite restaurants, usually filtered via type of cuisine and choose from available items. Online Restaurant Management System is a process of reserving seats or booking tables in advance from a restaurant or food co-operative through a web page or app. It allows to easily compare different menu item available in different restaurants and their price which reduces traveling cost and time.

 In this System Restaurant management can easily do their work, have less work load and save their time. Also, customers can simply order food and reserve time slot for a table in advance from home. So that, customers do not have to wait in restaurant. From the homepage, both customers and admin can access the website. Customer can create account or login if he has account previously. After login customer will be re-directed to welcome page from where customer can see a menu, and information of nearby restaurants. Also, customer can book an event or multiple time slots from the reservation in advance and see their reservation information. No customer can book an already reserved time slot. Admin can login from the homepage, he can add new food item, update or delete any restaurant information from the web page, and can view/modify all customers information.

3. Motivation:
